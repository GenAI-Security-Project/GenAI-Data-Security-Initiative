# LLM Top 10 2025 × CIS Controls v8.1

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)
to the [CIS Controls v8.1](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls) — the
Center for Internet Security's prioritised set of safeguards for
cyber defence, organised into 18 control groups with Implementation
Groups (IG1/IG2/IG3) scaling from small organisations to enterprises.

CIS Controls are highly practical and action-oriented. Every safeguard
maps to specific tools and activities. For LLM security, the most
relevant controls are distributed across data protection (CIS 3),
secure configuration (CIS 4), account management (CIS 5), audit log
management (CIS 8), application software security (CIS 16), incident
response (CIS 17), and penetration testing (CIS 18).

---

## CIS Controls structure

| Group | Controls | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Basic hygiene (IG1) | CIS 1–6 | Asset inventory, software, data protection, secure config, account management, access control |
| Foundational (IG2) | CIS 7–11 | Vulnerability management, audit logs, email/web, malware, network |
| Organisational (IG3) | CIS 12–18 | Network monitoring, security awareness, app security, incident response, pen testing |

**Implementation Groups:**
- IG1 — Essential cyber hygiene, small to medium organisations
- IG2 — IG1 + additional controls for organisations with sensitive data
- IG3 — IG2 + advanced controls for enterprise and regulated industries

### LLM01 — Prompt Injection

**Severity:** Critical

Malicious instructions in user input or processed content manipulate
LLM behaviour, bypassing safety controls.

#### CIS Controls mapping

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational (IG1)**
- CIS 8.2: Enable audit logging for all LLM input channels —

  application layer before content reaches the model

**Hardening (IG2)**
- CIS 16.1/16.2: Establish secure coding standards covering
  LLM integration — input validation requirements reviewed in
  code review for all LLM-related pull requests
- Deploy runtime prompt injection detection — active monitoring
  on input channels, not just passive logging
- Maintain adversarial test suite covering direct, indirect,
  and jailbreak injection vectors

**Advanced (IG3)**
- CIS 18.1: Include prompt injection scenarios in penetration
  testing programme — cover your specific RAG sources, tool
  descriptor paths, and document processing pipelines
- Implement architectural separation between system prompt
  and user input — structural guarantee, not just policy

### LLM02 — Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Severity:** High

LLMs expose PII, financial data, proprietary code, or confidential
information through outputs — from training data memorisation or

  sensitive training data cannot be reconstructed from outputs

  generation for sensitive corpora
- CIS 18.1: Include data disclosure scenarios in penetration

### LLM06 — Excessive Agency

**Severity:** High

unintended or harmful actions when manipulated.

#### CIS Controls mapping

| Control | Safeguard | IG | How it applies |

  minimum scope enforced, regular reviews, no standing
  broad permissions across all tools
- CIS 6.1: Establish formal process for granting LLM tool
  access — documented justification, approval, and regular
  review required for every tool permission
- Require human confirmation for every irreversible action
  triggered by LLM output — separate confirmation interface

**Hardening (IG2)**

  invocations — tool identity, parameters, user session,
  timestamp — immutable trail
- Deploy action guardrails as an independent layer from
  the model — structural enforcement of permitted scope

### LLM07 — System Prompt Leakage

**Severity:** High

**Foundational (IG1)**
- CIS 3.1: Classify system prompts as sensitive configuration —

  secrets and operational configuration
- CIS 4.1: Establish secure configuration requirement — system
  prompts never stored in cleartext configuration files,
  source code, or environment variables without encryption
- CIS 8.2: Log all access to system prompt storage — detect

  the network layer — not just at the application layer —
  preventing saturation of shared infrastructure
- Per-tenant cost budgets with automatic suspension on breach —
  not just alerting

  isolated from other system availability

**Advanced (IG3)**
- CIS 18.1: Include resource exhaustion in penetration
  testing — sponge example attacks and token amplification
  scenarios against your specific deployment
